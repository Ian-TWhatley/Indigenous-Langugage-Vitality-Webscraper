# Introduction
Indigenous languages on Turtle Island have seen rapid decreases in their number of speakers due to colonialism and genocide.
Although many of these languages are small, this doesn't paint a full picture of a given language's survival given that the affected nations often have similarly small populations.
This project seeks to provide an updated account of indigenous language vitality by sourcing data from Wikipedia and Ethnologue.
Note that it is currently not complete and this repo is currently only a shell. However, future plans include:
* Data analysis on regions, ethnic groups, and trends
* Detailed accounts and resources for these languages
* Any suggested features
