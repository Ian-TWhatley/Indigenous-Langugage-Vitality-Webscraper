# Introduction
Indigenous laguages on Turtle Island have seen rapid decrease in their numbers due legacies of colonialism and genocide.
Although many languages are small, this doesn't paint the full picture of the language's survival given many of nation who 
speak these languages have similarly small numbers.
This project seeks to provide an updated account of indigenous langugage vitaly by sourcing data from Wikipedia and Ethnlogue. Note, it is currently not complete
and this file is currently only a shell. However, future plans include
\begin{itemize}
\item Data analysis on regions, ethnic groups, and trends
\item Detailed accounts and resources for these languages
\item Any suggested features
\end{itemize}
